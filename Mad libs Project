# This project will use string concatenation and f-string formatting to create a short Mad lib.

adj = input("Adjective: ")
verb = input("Verb: ")
famous_person = input("Person: ")

madlib = f"I really enjoy doing makeup because it is {adj}. \
It makes me excited because I get to {verb} my creative side. \
I hope to one day be as good at it as {famous_person}."

# For example:
print(madlib)
